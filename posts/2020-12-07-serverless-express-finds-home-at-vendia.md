__*Tl;dr: The Serverless Express open source project has graduated from AWS Labs and is now being actively supported and sponsored by Vendia!*__

Back in 2016 I was General Manager of two up-and-coming AWS Services: AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. 

APIs were already well understood by our customer base, but selling Lambda was initially a little more difficult - not only was the idea of a fully managed, pay-by-the-call function hosting service a novelty among public cloud providers, it was also very different from existing developer practices. Case in point: _Express-based web services_.

Lambda launched with support for nodejs, which helped a lot of customers start using it easily, given their existing familiarity with JavaScript. But for many customers, just having a familiar language wasn’t enough — they were also looking for familiar frameworks, such as Express, on which to build their Lambda-based web applications.

After hearing this feedback from many customers, we realized we needed to “meet customers where they were” by bringing Serverless solutions to existing frameworks….and thus the Serverless Express GitHub project was born! 

Over the course of the last four years many developers have adopted Serverless solutions, including Serverless Express, to help accelerate development and gain Serverless benefits like lower operational overhead, automatic per-request scaling, built-in fault tolerance, and pay-per-call pricing. Today, the Serverless Express npm package gets over 265K downloads per week, and its GitHub project has 3.7K stars.

The original author of the Serverless Express project, Brett Andrews, joined Vendia recently, and we realized we can do even more in our mission to help customers share code and data effectively by giving back to the open source community by helping the Serverless Express project “graduate” from its initial location in AWS Labs to a permanent place in Vendia’s repository. As the original project sponsor, and with the guidance of the project’s original author, we look forward to being thoughtful and proactive stewards of this project.

_What’s in it for Vendia?_ First of all, Brett and I feel a strong connection to helping the Serverless community succeed. Technologies like Lambda, managed API and database services, and other Serverless offerings power Vendia’s implementations and help us deliver scalable, low-cost code and data sharing solutions for our customers. We also continue to believe strongly in the mission of Serverless Express: To give developers a simple, scalable platform that meets them where they are, and then helps them gain the best of what the cloud has to offer...without unnecessary retraining, rewriting, or porting exercises. We're also excited to find ways to bring Vendia Share - the next generation Serverless platform - and Serverless Express users closer together with easy ways to use both platforms in combination.

To all the existing (and future) Serverless Express users, we look forward to making your experience even better. To all the project contributors, we look forward to being great partners, building on your existing contributions and successes in this project. And to AWS, a huge “Thank You” for believing in this idea back when it felt risky and uncertain,and for allowing it to leave the nest now that it’s grown. Stay tuned for more technical and project roadmap details coming soon...and _Go Serverless!_

_About Vendia_
_Vendia was founded in 2020 by AWS veterans Shruthi Rao, Business Director of AWS Blockchain and Tim Wagner, inventor of AWS Lambda. Vendia solves the dispersed data problem by making it easy to share code and data across companies, clouds, geographies, and technology stacks. Vendia combines serverless architectures with distributed ledger technologies to create products that are simultaneously easier to deploy and operate and far more scalable than existing ERP, Blockchain, and API-based alternatives. Customers use Vendia Share and Vendia Virtual Data Lake to share transactions and files regardless of where they originate. Built in support for database-powered computations, web and mobile solutions, and IoT integrations enables customers to create company- and cloud-spanning business applications with breakthrough speed of development...and then deploy them with pay-per-transaction billing, little-to-no operational overhead, and one-click cloud service integration.
