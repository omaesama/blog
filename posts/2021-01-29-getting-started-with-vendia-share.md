# Getting Started with Vendia Share

Whether you are a developer, business manager, data scientist, or anything in between, getting started with Vendia Share is fast and easy.  In a matter of minutes, you can be on your way to creating distributed real-time applications, and sharing data across clouds, accounts, regions, and with partners. 

We are incredibly excited about our Developer Preview and have been hard at work creating content to accelerate your experience with Vendia Share. 

## Creating an Account
Before you can start creating, you will need a Vendia Share account.  You can quickly sign up at [https://share.vendia.net/signup](https://share.vendia.net/signup).

# Start thinking ‘uni-versally’
Universal Applications, or unis, are the foundation upon which you build with Vendia Share.  You can create your first uni from our web interface or using the Vendia Share Command Line Interface (CLI).  

Creating a uni requires zero code, however you do need a plan for your data model.

For more information on unis, checkout our [“What is a uni?” video](https://youtu.be/8HmwVOo17BE)

Read more about unis and how they work [https://vendia.net/docs/share/dev-and-use-unis](https://vendia.net/docs/share/dev-and-use-unis)

# Creating your first uni
Ready to get started? The Vendia team has put together some great quick starts to help guide you through the creation of your first uni.

If you prefer to use a web interface you can follow along at [https://vendia.net/docs/share/quickstart/web](https://vendia.net/docs/share/quickstart/web)

Prefer a terminal?  We have you covered - check out the [CLI quick start](https://vendia.net/docs/share/quickstart/cli)

# Diving Deeper
Once you are comfortable with the Vendia Share service and are ready to dive deeper, we encourage you to explore our more advanced quick starts.  

We believe that practical examples are a fantastic way to learn. As such, we have created some quick starts from use cases that are popular amongst our customers and the Vendia team.

## Shopping List
Get started with real-time data sharing strategies with this easy to understand quick start. You will build a uni that helps solve a common problem we all deal with, managing a shopping list.

## Track And Trace
The ability to share and work with data in real-time with partners is critical in supply chain management. This quick start demonstrates how you can quickly build a system to track goods and trace problems in a modern supply chain.

## Product Catalog
Build a product catalog with Vendia Share and get more familiar with some of our data management capabilities. You will expand your knowledge from prior quick starts and learn how to constrain data and work with multiple data types.

## Inventory Management
Deploy a sample inventory channel involving multiple parties such as a distribution center and two retailers. Build upon your existing knowledge by using our integrations.

# Developer Resources
Developers find learning Vendia Share is quick and easy. Our zero-code approach to APIs and a solution backed by leading serverless architecture greatly reduces the learning curve. Whether you are just getting started in this space or have been developing for years, we have some helpful resources that can accelerate building with Vendia Share.

## Introduction to GraphQL
Vendia Share APIs are generated with zero code from your data models. These APIs take advantage of GraphQL to make working with your data and sharing your code easy.  If you have not worked with GraphQL prior, this is a great place to start learning more.

## Data Modeling
Vendia Share works upon a data model (we call it Schema) that you define.  Share uses an industry standard specification for this model. Read more about that specification and find examples of its use here.

## Integrating with other systems
The ability to connect Vendia Share with other systems opens numerous possibilities. The fact that these integrations may exist in any given account, region, cloud, or partner, gives developers the flexibility to intelligently design solutions with Vendia Share.  Read more about our integration capabilities here.
